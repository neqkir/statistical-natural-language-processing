#### Introduction

*.Rationalist ( 1960-1985, e.g., Chomsky ) vs. empiricist ( 1920-1960, resurging nowadays ) approach to language*

Rationalists think a significant part of the knowledge in a human mind is not derived by the senses but fixed in advance, presumably by genetic inheritance.

Empiricists also postulate some cognitive abilities present in the brain, but don't think the mind begins with detailed sets of principles or procedures specific to the various components of language and other cognitive domains, but with general operations for association, pattern recognition and generalization, applied to the sensory data.

An empiricist framework allows an interest for statistical NLP.

*.Linguistics should answer*

-What kind of things do people say?

-What do these things say/ask/request about the world?

*.Grammaticality, no binary rule to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical occurences*
